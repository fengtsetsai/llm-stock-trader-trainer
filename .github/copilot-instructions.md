# Python Coding Conventions

## Python Instructions

- Write clear and concise comments for each function **in English**.
- Ensure functions have descriptive names and include type hints.
- Provide docstrings following PEP 257 conventions **in English**.
- Use the `typing` module for type annotations (e.g., `List[str]`, `Dict[str, int]`).
- Break down complex functions into smaller, more manageable functions.

## General Instructions

- Always prioritize readability and clarity.
- For algorithm-related code, include explanations of the approach used **in English**.
- Write code with good maintainability practices, including comments on why certain design decisions were made **in English**.
- Handle edge cases and write clear exception handling.
- For libraries or external dependencies, mention their usage and purpose in comments **in English**.
- Use consistent naming conventions and follow language-specific best practices.
- Write concise, efficient, and idiomatic code that is also easily understandable.
